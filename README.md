# SlimeBasedReverseRewrite
Slime Based Reverse is a simple java program/script that reverse engineers Minecraft seeds based on Slimechunk data. This method isn't the most efficient but works

This version of the program relies on a simple webserver found [here](https://github.com/BOEM25/SlimeBasedChunk/tree/master), the webserver is there to allow the program to run on multiple systems at once since there are a lot of seeds and that takes time so spilliting the load should make it faster (Note, the webserver needs improvement :))

also, this is my first big project with Java and I'm still learning a lot so please don't hate me.
